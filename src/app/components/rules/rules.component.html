<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>
  Shiny Pokémon of the Fortnight Official Rules
</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Each competition typically runs from 00:00 (12:00am) on Sunday to 23:59 (11:59pm) on Saturday two weeks later for a total of 14 days.  (It STARTS at the beginning of Sunday and ENDS at the end of Saturday)
  </li>
  <li>
    Competition start and end time is based in Pacific Standard Time (PST).
  </li>
  <li>
    Participants can hunt in any main series game...and Pokemon Go too.
  </li>
  <li>
    Events with boosted rates (promoted raids, events<span class="popover-link" ngbPopover="Promoted shinies caught on Community Day in Pokemon Go are not worth points.">*</span>) will count toward points, pending the approval of the most recent fortnight's champion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Participants can use any hunting method available (random encounters, run aways, catch combo, horde hunting, poke radar, SOS, "murder method", masuda method, soft resetting, wormholes, dynamax adventures, raiding)
  </li>
  <li>
    Hacking, cloning, swap breeding, knowingly entering raid dens where you're certain to encounter a shiny--all of these are examples of not competing fairly within the competition. No exploits, known or unknown, should be utilised for your hunt. If you're uncertain if your method is considered legitimate, ask the channel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hunting with external hardware (controllers with turbo functions, Switch Up, Go-tchas, etc.) is considered illegal as it does not require the hunter's attention or physical presence to get their target.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are doing a Masuda hunt, you cannot start gathering eggs until the theme formally starts. The hunt begins at midnight and gathering eggs is viewed as part of the hunt. The same is true for starting a radar chain or beginning an SOS chain.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use of Shiny Charm and Masuda Method are encouraged. If you do not have a shiny charm, we will be happy to help you get one.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any disagreement over the rules will be settled with either polite discussion in Slack, or a duel to the death.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Scoring</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Each user is to post photographic proof of having caught the Pokemon within the allotted time period.  A successful shiny caught will result in one (1) point.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each participant can only submit one Pokémon, there are no further points for additional catches, unless stipulated at the beginning of the hunt.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some special competitions may have different scoring rules. The last fortnight of the year is a “Free for All” where all Pokémon are worth 1 point, but you can catch as many as you like.  Each unique Pokemon forme is worth 1 point.<span class="popover-link" ngbPopover="Spinda has one forme!">**</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Only catches made in the competition period will count.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Verification</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    All catches must come with photographic proof. This should be uploaded to an external image host and a link posted in Slack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your in game name must be visible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Date of capture must be visible and fall within the period of the current competition (adjusted for timezone).
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Theme Selection</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    The winner of the previous competition gets to pick the theme for the next competition.
  </li>
  <li>
    Themes should allow for a variety of Pokémon to be caught. Many of us have a lot of shinies already and it's more fun to have the option to catch something new.
  </li>
  <li>
    Themes that are relevant to real life events are encouraged (Spooky theme at Halloween etc).
  </li>
  <li>
    Ideally, there should be clear criteria for exactly which Pokémon count toward the theme, either based on specific Pokémon list or a clearly identifiable attribute like type. e.g. a Spooky theme could be any ghost type, but a “Food” theme would need a specific list of qualifying Pokémon.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you're really stuck for a theme, feel free to ask for help. If you're not going to be available, you can delegate theme selection to another player.
  </li>
  <li>
    Themes should be chosen to provide maximum enjoyment rather than difficulty or frustration.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Conditionals</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    If a winner does not select a theme by the start of the next fortnight OR nobody gets a point in a given fortnight, a run-off will occur.
  </li>
  <li>
    The first person to catch a shiny Pokemon, same rules as above, during this run-off, selects the theme for the fortnight.
  </li>
  <li>
    This immediately ends the run-off.  The person who ends the run-off does not get a point.
  </li>
</ol>
